游릭 sequential-thinking - Ready (1 tool)
Tools:

- sequentialthinking
  A detailed tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving through thoughts.
  This tool helps analyze problems through a flexible thinking process that can adapt and evolve.
  Each thought can build on, question, or revise previous insights as understanding deepens.

  When to use this tool:

  - Breaking down complex problems into steps
  - Planning and design with room for revision
  - Analysis that might need course correction
  - Problems where the full scope might not be clear initially
  - Problems that require a multi-step solution
  - Tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps
  - Situations where irrelevant information needs to be filtered out

  Key features:

  - You can adjust total_thoughts up or down as you progress
  - You can question or revise previous thoughts
  - You can add more thoughts even after reaching what seemed like the end
  - You can express uncertainty and explore alternative approaches
  - Not every thought needs to build linearly - you can branch or backtrack
  - Generates a solution hypothesis
  - Verifies the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps
  - Repeats the process until satisfied
  - Provides a correct answer

  Parameters explained:

  - thought: Your current thinking step, which can include:

  * Regular analytical steps
  * Revisions of previous thoughts
  * Questions about previous decisions
  * Realizations about needing more analysis
  * Changes in approach
  * Hypothesis generation
  * Hypothesis verification

  - next_thought_needed: True if you need more thinking, even if at what seemed like the end
  - thought_number: Current number in sequence (can go beyond initial total if needed)
  - total_thoughts: Current estimate of thoughts needed (can be adjusted up/down)
  - is_revision: A boolean indicating if this thought revises previous thinking
  - revises_thought: If is_revision is true, which thought number is being reconsidered
  - branch_from_thought: If branching, which thought number is the branching point
  - branch_id: Identifier for the current branch (if any)
  - needs_more_thoughts: If reaching end but realizing more thoughts needed

  You should:

  1. Start with an initial estimate of needed thoughts, but be ready to adjust
  2. Feel free to question or revise previous thoughts
  3. Don't hesitate to add more thoughts if needed, even at the "end"
  4. Express uncertainty when present
  5. Mark thoughts that revise previous thinking or branch into new paths
  6. Ignore information that is irrelevant to the current step
  7. Generate a solution hypothesis when appropriate
  8. Verify the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps
  9. Repeat the process until satisfied with the solution
  10. Provide a single, ideally correct answer as the final output
  11. Only set next_thought_needed to false when truly done and a satisfactory answer is reached

游릭 think-tool - Ready (4 tools)
Tools:

- clear_thoughts

游릭 context7 - Ready (2 tools)
Tools:

- get-library-docs
  Fetches up-to-date documentation for a library. You must call 'resolve-library-id' first to obtain the exact Context7-compatible library ID required to use this tool, UNLESS the user explicitly provides a
  library ID in the format '/org/project' or '/org/project/version' in their query.
- resolve-library-id
  Resolves a package/product name to a Context7-compatible library ID and returns a list of matching libraries.

  You MUST call this function before 'get-library-docs' to obtain a valid Context7-compatible library ID UNLESS the user explicitly provides a library ID in the format '/org/project' or '/org/project/version'
  in their query.

  Selection Process:

  1. Analyze the query to understand what library/package the user is looking for
  2. Return the most relevant match based on:

  - Name similarity to the query (exact matches prioritized)
  - Description relevance to the query's intent
  - Documentation coverage (prioritize libraries with higher Code Snippet counts)
  - Trust score (consider libraries with scores of 7-10 more authoritative)

  Response Format:

  - Return the selected library ID in a clearly marked section
  - Provide a brief explanation for why this library was chosen
  - If multiple good matches exist, acknowledge this but proceed with the most relevant one
  - If no good matches exist, clearly state this and suggest query refinements

  For ambiguous queries, request clarification before proceeding with a best-guess match.

游릭 open-aware - Ready (3 tools)
Tools:

- ask
  Delivers quick, focused answers to coding questions by retrieving the most relevant snippets from your indexed repositories and synthesizing a concise explanation.
  Built for LLM agents, it uses semantic search and light reasoning (no multi-step navigation) to return evidence-backed responses with essential code excerpts and file paths, ideal for fast Q&A.
- deep_research
  Performs deep, agentic, multi-step research across selected repositories to answer complex coding questions.
  Chains semantic search, file navigation, and file reading to synthesize evidence-backed explanations with relevant code excerpts and paths.
  It goes beyond snippet retrieval to map relationships across files and components for true codebase understanding.
  This tool acts as a sub-agent. Send queries as if instructing another agent.
- get_context
  Retrieves contextually relevant code snippets based on semantic similarity to the input query.

  ## Purpose

  Use this endpoint to find code examples, implementation patterns, or technical documentation that
  semantically matches a programming query. The system performs vector similarity search across indexed
  code repositories to return the most relevant snippets.

  ## When to use

  - When seeking code implementation examples for specific tasks or patterns
  - When researching how certain functionality is implemented across specific repositories
  - When needing contextual information about programming concepts in specific repositories
  - When assembling reference material for coding tasks

  ## Parameters

  - `query`: String describing the coding concept, pattern or implementation you're searching for.
    More specific queries yield better results. Example: "async file upload handling in FastAPI"

  - `similarity_top_k`: Integer specifying the maximum number of results to return, ranked by
    relevance score. If omitted, system default limits apply. For comprehensive searches,
    values between 40-60 are recommended.

  - `tags_ids`: Optional list of strings representing tag identifiers to filter results by repository tags.

  - `repositories`: Optional list of strings specifying repository identifiers to narrow the search scope.
    For GitHub, use the format `<org_id>/<repo_id>`.
    For Bitbucket Data Center, use `/projects/<namespace_id>/repos/<repo_id>`.

  - `language`: Optional list of programming languages to filter the search results by language.

  - `max_results`: Optional integer specifying the maximum number of results to return after reranking.

  - `filtering_extra_instructions`: Optional string providing additional instructions for filtering the results.

  ## Filtering behavior

  - You may provide either `tags_ids`, `repositories`, or both.
  - If both are provided, results will include matches from either source (logical OR).
  - If neither is provided, the search is performed across all indexed repositories.

  ## Response format

  Returns ContextRetrieverResponse object.

  ## Usage examples

  1. Find FastAPI authentication implementations:

  ```json
     POST /context/retrieve with body:
     {
       "query": "fastapi oauth2 password authentication",
       "similarity_top_k": 40
     }
  ```

  2. Search for error handling patterns in specific repositories:

  ```json
      POST /context/retrieve
      {
        "query": "python exception handling best practices",
        "similarity_top_k": 40,
        "repositories": ["org123/api-utils"],
        "language": ["python"]
      }
  ```

  ## Notes

  - Results are ordered by semantic relevance to the query
  - For best results, use specific technical terminology in queries
  - When known, use `tags_ids`, `repositories`, and `language` to narrow the search scope for more focused results.

  This function automatically handles the SCAN cursor
  iteration to collect all matching keys.
  It's safer than KEYS \* for large databases but will still
  collect all results in memory.

  丘멆잺 WARNING: With very large datasets (millions of keys),
  this may consume significant memory.
  For large-scale operations, consider using scan_keys()
  with manual iteration instead.

  Args:
  pattern: Pattern to match keys against (default is
  "\*" for all keys).
  batch_size: Number of keys to scan per iteration
  (default 100).

  Returns:
  A list of all keys matching the pattern or an error
  message.

- scan_keys
  Scan keys in the Redis database using the SCAN command
  (non-blocking, production-safe).

  丘멆잺 IMPORTANT: This returns PARTIAL results from one
  iteration. Use scan_all_keys()
  to get ALL matching keys, or call this function multiple
  times with the returned cursor
  until cursor becomes 0.

  The SCAN command iterates through the keyspace in small
  chunks, making it safe to use
  on large databases without blocking other operations.

  Args:
  pattern: Pattern to match keys against (default is
  "_" for all keys).
  Common patterns: "user:_", "cache:_",
  "_:123", etc.
  count: Hint for the number of keys to return per
  iteration (default 100).
  Redis may return more or fewer keys than this
  hint.
  cursor: The cursor position to start scanning from (0
  to start from beginning).
  To continue scanning, use the cursor value
  returned from previous call.

  Returns:
  A dictionary containing: - 'cursor': Next cursor position (0 means scan is
  complete) - 'keys': List of keys found in this iteration
  (PARTIAL RESULTS) - 'total_scanned': Number of keys returned in this
  batch - 'scan_complete': Boolean indicating if scan is
  finished
  Or an error message if something goes wrong.

  Example usage:
  First call: scan*keys("user:*") -> returns
  cursor=1234, keys=[...], scan*complete=False
  Next call: scan_keys("user:*", cursor=1234) ->
  continues from where it left off
  Final call: returns cursor=0, scan_complete=True when
  done

游릭 postman (from postman) - Ready (38 tools)
Tools:

- createCollection
  Creates a collection using the [Postman Collection v2.1.0 schema
  format](https://schema.postman.com/collection/json/v2.1.0/draft-07/docs/index.html).

  **Note:**

  If you do not include the \`workspace\` query parameter, the system creates the collection in the
  oldest personal Internal workspace you own.

- createCollectionRequest
  Creates a request in a collection. For a complete list of properties, refer to the **Request**
  entry in the [Postman Collection Format
  documentation](https://schema.postman.com/collection/json/v2.1.0/draft-07/docs/index.html).

  **Note:**

  It is recommended that you pass the \`name\` property in the request body. If you do not, the
  system uses a null value. As a result, this creates a request with a blank name.

- createCollectionResponse
  Creates a request response in a collection. For a complete list of request body properties, refer
  to the **Response** entry in the [Postman Collection Format
  documentation](https://schema.postman.com/collection/json/v2.1.0/draft-07/docs/index.html).

  **Note:**

  It is recommended that you pass the \`name\` property in the request body. If you do not, the
  system uses a null value. As a result, this creates a response with a blank name.

- createEnvironment
  Creates an environment.

  **Note:**

  - The request body size cannot exceed the maximum allowed size of 30MB.
  - If you receive an HTTP \`411 Length Required\` error response, manually pass the
    \`Content-Length\` header and its value in the request header.
  - If you do not include the \`workspace\` query parameter, the system creates the environment in
    the oldest personal Internal workspace you own.

- createMock
  Creates a mock server in a collection.

  - Pass the collection UID (ownerId-collectionId), not the bare collection ID.
  - If you only have a \`collectionId\`, resolve the UID first:
    1. Prefer GET \`/collections/{collectionId}\` and read \`uid\`, or
    2. Construct \`{ownerId}-{collectionId}\` using ownerId from GET \`/me\`:
    - For team-owned collections: \`ownerId = me.teamId\`
    - For personal collections: \`ownerId = me.user.id\`
  - Use the \`workspace\` query to place the mock in a specific workspace. Prefer explicit workspace
    scoping.

- createSpec
  Creates an API specification in Postman's [Spec
  Hub](https://learning.postman.com/docs/design-apis/specifications/overview/). Specifications can be
  single or multi-file.

  **Note:**

  - Postman supports OpenAPI 3.0 and AsyncAPI 2.0 specifications.
  - If the file path contains a \`/\` (forward slash) character, then a folder is created. For
    example, if the path is the \`components/schemas.json\` value, then a \`components\` folder is
    created with the \`schemas.json\` file inside.
  - Multi-file specifications can only have one root file.
  - Files cannot exceed a maximum of 10 MB in size.

- createSpecFile
  Creates an API specification file.

  **Note:**

  - If the file path contains a \`/\` (forward slash) character, then a folder is created. For
    example, if the path is the \`components/schemas.json\` value, then a \`components\` folder is
    created with the \`schemas.json\` file inside.
  - Creating a spec file assigns it the \`DEFAULT\` file type.
  - Multi-file specifications can only have one root file.
  - Files cannot exceed a maximum of 10 MB in size.

- createWorkspace
  Creates a new [workspace](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspace
  s/creating-workspaces/).

  **Note:**

  - This endpoint returns a 403 \`Forbidden\` response if the user does not have permission to create
    workspaces. [Admins and Super Admins](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/rol
    es-and-permissions/#team-roles) can configure workspace permissions to restrict users and/or user
    groups from creating workspaces or require approvals for the creation of team workspaces.
  - There are rate limits when publishing public workspaces.
  - Public team workspace names must be unique.

  ### Important

  We deprecated linking collections or environments between workspaces. We do not recommend that you
  do this.

  If you have a linked collection or environment, note the following:

  - The endpoint does not create a clone of a collection or environment.

  We have deprecated the \`name\` and \`uid\` responses in the following array of objects:

  - \`collections\`
  - \`environments\`
  - \`mocks\`
  - \`monitors\`
  - \`apis\`

- getWorkspaces
  Gets all workspaces you have access to.
  - For 랈y 뷕 requests, first call GET \`/me\` and pass \`createdBy={me.user.id}\`.
  - This endpoint's response contains the visibility field. Visibility determines who can access the
    workspace:
    - \`personal\`  Only you can access the workspace.
    - \`team\`  All team members can access the workspace.
    - \`private\`  Only invited team members can access the workspace (Professional and Enterprise).
    - \`public\`  Everyone can access the workspace.
    - \`partner\`  Invited team members and partners (Professional and Enterprise).
  - For tools that require the workspace ID, and no workspace ID is provided, ask the user to provide
    the workspace ID. If the user does not provide the workspace ID, call this first with the createdBy
    parameter to use the first workspace.
  - Examples:
    - List my workspaces  GET \`/me\`, then GET \`/workspaces?createdBy={me.user.id}\`
    - List my personal workspaces  GET \`/me\`, then GET
      \`/workspaces?type=personal&createdBy={me.user.id}\`
    - List all public workspaces  GET \`/workspaces?type=public\`
- publishMock
  Publishes a mock server. Publishing a mock server sets its **Access Control** configuration setting

  format](https://schema.postman.com/collection/json/v2.1.0/draft-07/docs/index.html). Include the
  collection's ID values in the request body. If you do not, the endpoint removes the existing items
  and creates new items.

  To perform an update asynchronously, use the \`Prefer\` header with the \`respond-async\` value.
  When performing an async update, this endpoint returns a HTTP \`202 Accepted\` response.

  **Note:**

  - The maximum collection size this endpoint accepts cannot exceed 100 MB.
  - If you don't include the collection items' ID values from the request body, the endpoint
    **removes** the existing items and recreates the items with new ID values.
  - To copy another collection's contents to the given collection, remove all ID values before you
    pass it in this endpoint. If you do not, this endpoint returns an error. These values include the
    \`id\`, \`uid\`, and \`postman_id\` values.
  - For protocol profile behavior, refer to Postman's [Protocol Profile Behavior documentation](https
    ://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-runtime/blob/develop/docs/protocol-profile-behavior.md).

- putEnvironment
  Replaces all the contents of an environment with the given information.

  ### Important

  We deprecated linking collections or environments between workspaces. We do not recommend that you
  do this.

  If you have a linked collection or environment, note the following:

  - The endpoint does not create a clone of a collection or environment.
  - Any changes you make to a linked collection or environment changes them in all workspaces.
  - If you delete a collection or environment linked between workspaces, the system deletes it in all
    the workspaces.
